Arrived at Princeton University and started working with Prof. Ellen Zhong on elucidating chemical structure from Nuclear Magnestic Resonance (NMR) spectrum. I am also excited to learn more about structural biology and various problems relating to cryo-electron microscopy in the [Zhong Lab](https://ezlab.princeton.edu/)!

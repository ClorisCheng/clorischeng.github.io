Arrived at Princeton University and started working with Prof. Ellen Zhong on a project about chemical structure elucidation from Nuclear Magnestic Resonance (NMR) spectrum. I am also excited to learn more about structural biology and various problems relating to cryo-electron microscopy in the [Zhong Lab](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zhonge/)!

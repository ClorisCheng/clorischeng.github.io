I will be presenting the work **"Practical Bayesian Algorithm Execution via Posterior Sampling"** at the [2024 INFORMS Annual Meeting](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/seattle2024/register/) as one of the finalists for the [Undergraduate Operations Research Prize](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Undergraduate-Operations-Research-Prize). If you are attending the conference, I would love to meet with you and chat! :smile:

Thanks for stopping by! I am Chu Xin (Cloris) Cheng, a junior at California Institute of Technology majoring in CS. I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Yisong Yue](https://yisongyue.com/[) and Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) from Caltech, and Prof. [Yanan Sui](https://yanansui.com/) from Tsinghua University. 

My past research centers around dealing with uncertainties in optimization and decision-making processes. From designing efficient sampling algorithms for high dimensional problems using Bayesian optimization and MCMC to leveraging human feedback using bandit algorithms for exoskeleton gaits, I am intrigued by problems that interleaves theoretical challenges and practical application. Recently, I have also started to explore applying Bayesian optimization to experimental design problems, and I am excited to see how general machine learning tools can be used to accelerate scientific discovery.

At Caltech, I am surrouned by so many brilliant people, and I am forever grateful to have had the opportunity to learn and collaborate with [Raul M. Astudillo](https://raulastudillo.netlify.app/), [Chris Yeh](https://chrisyeh96.github.io/), [Yiheng Lin](https://yihenglin97.github.io/) and many more amazing people on various projects.

You are welcome to take a look at my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_cheng_2024.pdf).

Thanks for stopping by! I am Chu Xin (Cloris) Cheng, a senior at California Institute of Technology majoring in CS. I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Yisong Yue](https://yisongyue.com/[) and Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) from Caltech, Prof. [Ellen Zhong](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zhonge/) from Princeton, and Prof. [Yanan Sui](https://yanansui.com/) from Tsinghua University. 

My past research centers around dealing with *uncertainties* in *optimization* and *decision-making processes*. From **designing efficient sampling algorithms for high dimensional problems** using Bayesian optimization and MCMC to **leveraging human feedback using bandit algorithms** for exoskeleton gaits, I am intrigued by problems that interleave theoretical challenges and practical application. Recently, I am also exploring applications of **Bayesian optimization in experimental design problems**, and I am excited to see how general machine learning tools can be used to accelerate scientific discovery.

At Caltech, I am surrounded by so many brilliant minds, and I am forever grateful to have had the opportunity to learn and collaborate with [Raul M. Astudillo](https://raulastudillo.netlify.app/), [Chris Yeh](https://chrisyeh96.github.io/), [Yiheng Lin](https://yihenglin97.github.io/) and many more amazing people on various projects.

You are welcomed to take a look at my **CV** [here](/assets/pdf/CV_cheng_2024.pdf).

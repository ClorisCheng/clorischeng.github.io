Thanks for stopping by! I am Chu Xin (Cloris) Cheng, a senior at California Institute of Technology majoring in CS. I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Yisong Yue](https://yisongyue.com/[) and Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) from Caltech, Prof. [Ellen Zhong](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zhonge/) from Princeton, and Prof. [Yanan Sui](https://yanansui.com/) from Tsinghua University. I will be working as a Machine Learning Intern at [Gridmatic](https://www.gridmatic.com/) during the spring.

My past research centers around **AI for accelerating scientific discovery**, specifically focusing on two subfields: **AI for experimental design** and **machine learning in chemistry**. I'd like to

- **Develop rigorous algorithms**, as mathematical foundations allow methods to withstand the test of time. 
- Work on intellectually stimulating problems that can tackle **new challenges** and help define **new frameworks**.
- Contribute to ways that allow smooth integration of machine learning to **real application domains**.

Recently, I'm exploring applications of generative modeling in discrete data generation and time series forecasting. 

At Caltech, I've learned so much from the brilliant people around me, and I am forever grateful to have had the opportunity to learn and collaborate with [Raul M. Astudillo](https://raulastudillo.netlify.app/), [Chris Yeh](https://chrisyeh96.github.io/), [Yiheng Lin](https://yihenglin97.github.io/) and many more amazing people on various projects.

You are welcomed to take a look at my **CV** [here](/assets/pdf/CV_cheng_2024.pdf).

<!-- I designed algorithms that could handle *multiphase, multi-criteria decision making in high dimensions* and developped frameworks to *generalize traditional Bayesian approaches* to more generalized, complex problem settings. Recently, I am exploring applications of machine learning to *elucidate natural product structures*, and it is both challenging and rewarding to test the limits of current methods in a new domain. -->


<!-- From **designing efficient sampling algorithms for high dimensional problems** using Bayesian optimization and MCMC to **leveraging human feedback using bandit algorithms** for exoskeleton gaits, I am intrigued by problems that interleave theoretical challenges and practical application. Recently, I am also exploring applications of **Bayesian optimization in experimental design problems**, and I am excited to see how general machine learning tools can be used to  -->
